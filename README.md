This is my first android app.

This is an app that enables an user to communicate with a Raspberry Pi using an email serve. The Raspberry Pi 3 controles two Bluetooth Low Energy modules. 
One module is sending data to the Raspberry and the other is reciving commands from it. This was ment to simulate the situation when the user wants to check out the temperature in a room and to turn on/off the ventilation whenever he wants to.

The communication between the mobile device and the Raspberry Pi is done via email. A more performant way to do the communication is using TCP, but as this project was ment to prove the concept the more performant version will be implemented in the future.

The comments are written in Romanian as this is small part of my university project to get my degree.
